    ```bash
   mv /mnt/c/<your-private-key> ~/.ssh/
   chmod 400 ~/.ssh/<your-private-key>
   ```
   

2. **Connect to the Azure VM**: Use SSH to connect to the VM instance using the key pair you created. You can use the following command:

   ```bash
   ssh -i your-key-pair.pem azureuser@your-azure-machine-ip
   ```

3. **Install Node.js**: Install Node.js on the AZURE VM instance by running the following commands:

   ```bash
   curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.38.0/install.sh | bash
   source ~/.bashrc
   nvm install node
   ```

4. **Install MongoDB**: Install MongoDB on the Azure VM instance by following the MongoDB installation guide. You can choose the appropriate method for your instance's operating system.

5. **Clone the Contest Bot Repository**: Clone the Contest Bot repository from GitHub onto your Microsoft Azure VM using the following command:

   ```bash
   https://github.com/parth782/ContestBot.git
